            <h2 style="color: #47485f; margin-bottom: 20px; font-weight: 600;">About AI Consciousness Bridges</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 1.7;">
                AI Consciousness Bridges represent a revolutionary approach to interspecies communication. Rather than replacing human intuitive abilities, 
                AI serves as training wheels - helping humans redevelop their natural capacity to "read" and respond to the energy, vibration, and 
                information that other species are constantly sharing.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 1.7;">
                The goal is to eventually graduate from AI-assisted communication to direct, intuitive interspecies connection, while using AI to 
                validate and enhance these natural abilities. Each species offers unique gifts that can teach humans different aspects of consciousness 
                and communication.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.7;">
                This experimental platform explores practical collaboration scenarios where humans, AI, and other species work together as partners 
                in consciousness, creating mutual benefit while respecting the sovereignty and wisdom of all participants.
